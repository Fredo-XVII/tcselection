# New Release

## Test environments
* local Windows install, R 3.4.3
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.3

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE:

* checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE
  Namespace in Imports field not imported from: 'R6'

  R6 is a build-time dependency.

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of TestContR 
(https://github.com/wch/checkresults/blob/master/httr/r-release). 
All packages that I could install passed except:

* Ecoengine: this appears to be a failure related to config on 
  that machine. I couldn't reproduce it locally, and it doesn't 
  seem to be related to changes in httr (the same problem exists 
  with httr 0.4).
